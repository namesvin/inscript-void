# Inscript
## A void Linux installer script

- Written in 100% BASH
- Easy to use
- The script is well-organized and easy to read, it uses standard Linux commands that are widely known and well-documented, and it automates the process of installing Void Linux, which can save a lot of time and effort. The script also uses variables and user input to make it more flexible and customizable, it also use curl to download the void-linux rootfs and it uses chroot to run command on the new installed system which is a good practice. Additionally, it uses fdisk and mkfs tools to create partition and file system which is a good way to initialize the disk. (Said by ChatGPT)
